    "# 1. Introduction to Neural Networks via Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we introduced **linear regression**, where we found a model that describes a target variable $y$ using a set of features $x_i$. In its simplest form, a linear model is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = w_0 x_0 + w_1 x_1 + \\dots + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned how to optimize the parameters $w_i$ and $b$ by minimizing the prediction error using **gradient descent**, which adjusts parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will reformulate this problem using a **neural network**. While neural networks are widely used in deep learning and can become quite complex, their fundamental structure is relatively simple. Linear regression serves as an excellent entry point to understand how neural networks work."
