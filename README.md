## Dependencies
We recommend using virtual environment for managing dependencies. </br>
- Create virtual environment: ```python3.10 -m venv venv```
- Activate the virtual environment: ```source venv/bin/activate```
- Install pipenv: ```pip install pipenv```
- Install dependencies: ```pipenv install```
- After you finish working with the code, you can deactivate the virtual environment: ```deactivate```

## Working with the code
- Run ```jupyter notebook```
- Navigate to the code you want to work with and open the notebook
